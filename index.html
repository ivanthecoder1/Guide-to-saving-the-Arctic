                    <h3> Summary of Arctic Ice Cap melting</h3>
                    <p>
                        According to NASA, the polar ice caps are melting at an alarming rate of 9% per decade due to the mass burning of fossil fuels. The thickness of the Arctic Ice has decreased by 40% since the 1960s. According to scientists at the U.S Center for Atmospheric Research, if the current rate of global temperature rise continues, the Arctic will be free of Ice by 2040. 

<br> </br> Some of you might ask, “Why does this matter?”. If the Arctic Ice Cap melts, there will be an increase in sea levels. This could potentially result in flooding in certain countries. In addition, the rise in sea level will disrupt the equilibrium of the cyclonic and anticyclonic structures making the weather conditions worse. Furthermore, animals that live in the Arctic such as polar bears will go extinct due to massive changes in their environment. There are many other consequences that could go into more detail, but the consequences are devastating not just for the animals but for us as well.
